## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- Take existing code and edit it, making sure it is accessible, and contains semantic elements.
- What problem does it solve? - Solves the issue with having non semantic elements, and pictures without alternative titles
- What did you learn? - how to go through pre-existing code, and reformatting it to make it "cleaner".

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
